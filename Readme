World Economic Dataset:

This dataset was created as part of a web scraping practice project, combining information from two different sources:

TradingEconomics.com → economic indicators such as GDP, growth, interest rate, inflation, unemployment, etc.
REST Countries API → geographic and demographic details such as country name, currency, capital, language, borders, and more.
The two sources are merged into a single dataset that can be useful for:

Global economic analysis
Geopolitical and demographic visualizations
Machine learning experiments
Country-level comparative studies
The scraping and data processing code is available in my GitHub repo


The dataset has 173 rows and 19 columns.

There are a few null values:
capital             1
borders            24
GDP Growth         72
Interest Rate      11
Inflation Rate      1
Jobless Rate        2
Gov. Budget         7
Debt/GDP            8
Current Account     6

One country Macau has its capital value as null, I'm dropping that value

And also the one country that has its inflation rate as null I'm dropping it

Lets drop both Monaco and Macau

For the borders, I'm leaving the null values as they are.

From the online resources the GDP growth could be a null value if there is no previous year to compare, missing GDP from previous or current year,
or if the country is newly added.

Similarly for the rest of the columns I'm leaving the nulls as they are because these nulls could actually mean missing data for that time.

After cleaning now the new dataset has 171 rows.
